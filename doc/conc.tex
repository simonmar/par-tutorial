\Section{concurrent}{Concurrent Haskell}

Concurrent Haskell \cite{jones96concurrent} is an extension to Haskell
2010 \cite{haskell2010} adding support for explicitly threaded
concurrent programming.  The basic interface remains largely unchanged
in its current implementation, although a number of embellishments have
since been added, which we will cover in later sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item Asynchronous exceptions \cite{spj:asynch-exceptions} were added
  as a means for asynchronous cancellation of threads,
\item Software Transactional Memory was added \cite{stm}, allowing
  safe composition of concurrent abstractions, and making it possible
  to safely build larger concurrent systems.
\item The behaviour of Concurrent Haskell in the presence of calls to
  and from foreign languages was specified \cite{conc-ffi}
\end{itemize}

% ToDo, someday:
% \Subsection{conc-data}{Shared concurrent data structures}

% IORef vs. MVar vs. STM?
% concurrent data structures?
% ref with mutable data structure in it?
